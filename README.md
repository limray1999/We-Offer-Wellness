## CS-GY-9953-S2022 Advanced Project I

WOW (We Offer Wellness) is a healthcare group having number of hospitals affiliated with it. After years of development,
it has become one of the largest healthcare groups in United States. Now, for better development in the future,
WOWâ€™s senior management decided to replace their old spread-sheet based system with a state-of-the-art Health Information Management
Systems.

WOW has engaged your team to design, develop, test and implement OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and DW (Data Warehouse)
database system. Based on that, they ask you the design a web application, for both user (patient) and administrator (manager),
to operate the database and do business activities easily.
